# Simple Dice Rolling Game

[Deployed as a GithubPage](https://mgrzb451.github.io/webdevpractice-dicegame1/)


A practice project of a very simple Dice Game from an online course.
During this project I practiced:
* using JavaScript classes to store player specific data
* toggling styles with JavaScript
* I learned that `.getElementById` is more performant than `.querySelector`; I'll be using ids for my interactice elements
* I learned that variable scope in JavaScript is quite different than in Python. I can mutate global variables inside function without either passing them as arguments or returning and overwriting them. Need to pay close attention to it and practice more!
